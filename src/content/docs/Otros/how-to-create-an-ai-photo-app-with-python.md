Let's learn how to build an image recognition application using Python and Taipy.  
We'll start by developing the model, and then we will use Taipy to build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to use it.  
The application will allow us to upload an image, and it will identify the content using our trained model.

Let‚Äôs start!  
The first phase is to create a Neural Network for image classification.  
We will use a Neural Network Builder from¬†**TensorFlow**¬†and the¬†**CIFAR-10**¬†dataset.  
Tensorflow is an essential for Artificial Intelligence library to develop and train our neural network.

[Star ‚≠ê the TensorFlow repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

The dataset comprises +50,000 images and is crucial for training image recognition models.  
We will be able to put our model to the test with Taipy, and build an application.

[Star ‚≠ê the Taipy repository](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy)

Your support means a lotüå±, and really helps us in so many ways, like writing articles! üôè

---

Our model will be trained on the ten categories present in the CIFAR dataset:

- airplane ‚úàÔ∏è
- automobile üöó
- bird ü¶ú
- cat üêà
- deer ü¶å
- dog üê∂
- frog üê∏
- horse üê¥
- ship ‚öì

Our model will be able to classify images into these ten categories.

### [](https://dev.to/taipy/how-to-create-an-ai-photo-app-with-python-23g8?ref=dailydev#prerequisites)Prerequisites

- **_Python_**- The Python programming language should be available on your computer
- **_virtualenv_**¬†- A tool for creating isolated virtual Python environments¬†_I will be using virtualenv for this project; however, you can use your preference, like venv, or Conda, and adapt your commands._

**_IMPORTANT : Depending on your setup, you might need to use the command python or python3 when running commands in the terminal_**

---

### [](https://dev.to/taipy/how-to-create-an-ai-photo-app-with-python-23g8?ref=dailydev#setup)Setup

Ok, time to build!  
Run these commands to set your project up:  

```
mkdir ml-photo-app
cd ml-photo-app
mkdir neural-network-builder
cd neural-network-builder
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd venv
```

Now let's install the real deal, two Python libraries:¬†**TensorFlow**¬†and¬†**numpy**-¬†_a library for mathematical operations on arrays._

Use the following command:  

```
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

### [](https://dev.to/taipy/how-to-create-an-ai-photo-app-with-python-23g8?ref=dailydev#download-cifar-dataset)Download CIFAR dataset

But first, data!  
Now, let‚Äôs download the CIFAR-10 dataset from¬†[here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

[![CIFAR](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbmvgqqxds91ps38n3pbm.png)](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbmvgqqxds91ps38n3pbm.png)

The one we need is the¬†_CIFAR-10 Python version_.  
When you download and unzip the files, you should see a folder named¬†_cifar-10-batches-py_.  
Copy that folder and all the files inside the project we just created:¬†_neural-network-builder/venv_.

### [](https://dev.to/taipy/how-to-create-an-ai-photo-app-with-python-23g8?ref=dailydev#python-script-generatemodelpy)Python script: generate-model.py

Create a file called¬†_generate-model.py_.  
This will be our Python script for the model training and exporting.  
  
Add the code below to the¬†_generate-model.py_.  

```python
import os
import shutil
import pickle
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models

def load_cifar10_data(data_dir):
    train_images = []
    train_labels = []

    for i in range(1, 6):
        with open(os.path.join(data_dir, f'data_batch_{i}'), 'rb') as f:
            data_dict = pickle.load(f, encoding='bytes')
            images = data_dict[b'data']
            labels = data_dict[b'labels']

            train_images.extend(images)
            train_labels.extend(labels)

    train_images = np.array(train_images).reshape(-1, 3,
                                                  32, 32).transpose(0, 2, 3, 1)
    train_labels = np.array(train_labels)

    with open(os.path.join(data_dir, 'test_batch'), 'rb') as f:
        data_dict = pickle.load(f, encoding='bytes')
        test_images = data_dict[b'data'].reshape(
            -1, 3, 32, 32).transpose(0, 2, 3, 1)
        test_labels = np.array(data_dict[b'labels'])

    return (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels)


def build_model():
    # Define the model architecture
    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(
        32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))
    model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))

    # Add dense layers on top
    model.add(layers.Flatten())
    model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
    model.add(layers.Dense(10))

    return model

def train_model(model, train_images, train_labels, test_images, test_labels):
    # Compile and train the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(
                      from_logits=True),
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=50,
                        validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))

    # Check if the model directory exists
    if os.path.exists('model'):
        # If it does, delete it
        shutil.rmtree('model')
    # Recreate the model directory
    os.makedirs('model')

    # Save the model
    model.save('model/cifar-10-batches-py-model.keras')

    return history

# Load and preprocess the CIFAR10 dataset
data_dir = 'C:/Users/marin/Documents/GitHub/AB/ml-photo-app/neural-network-builder/venv/cifar-10-batches-py'
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images,
                               test_labels) = load_cifar10_data(data_dir)


# Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1
train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0

# Build and train the model
model = build_model()
history = train_model(model, train_images, train_labels,
                      test_images, test_labels)


# Print the history dictionary
print(history.history)
```

### [](https://dev.to/taipy/how-to-create-an-ai-photo-app-with-python-23g8?ref=dailydev#run-the-generatemodelpy-script)Run the¬†_generate-model.py_¬†script

Moment of truth! Run your file.  
This file will build, train, and save our model.  
  
Depending on your computer, this process can take more or less time.

Let‚Äôs focus on the parameter called epochs in our script, which is set to¬†_epochs=50._

[![epochs](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fcb3mclcefqy3472itcv2.png)](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fcb3mclcefqy3472itcv2.png)

An epoch is an important hyperparameter, representing one complete cycle through all training datasets.  
Each sample will update the model‚Äôs parameters.  
This cycle is not about the time it takes but the number of times it runs through the data.  
This key parameter influences the training process. Indeed, having more epochs affects the model‚Äôs learning rate.  
  
The higher the number, the longer it will take to train the model.

Underfitting could happen if there are insufficient epochs for the model to identify the underlying patterns in the data. However, an excessive number of epochs might cause the model to overfit the training set, resulting in subpar generalization on fresh, untried data.

To run the script, use this command here (you might need to use¬†_python_¬†or¬†_python3_):  

```python
python3 generate-model.py
```

Now, a little patience! Wait for your model to be trained and saved in the¬†_model_¬†folder.  
When creating our GUI front end, we will copy that model folder.  
Now, let‚Äôs add a GUI to play with our model!

### [](https://dev.to/taipy/how-to-create-an-ai-photo-app-with-python-23g8?ref=dailydev#setup)Setup

Navigate back to the main project folder ml-photo-app and then run these scripts to set up our interface:  

``` bash
mkdir frontend
cd frontend
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd venv
```

Now, let‚Äôs install the Python libraries we will be using:

- Taipy
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Pillow ( PIL) - Python imaging library

Run this command:  

```python
pip install taipy tensorflow pillow numpy
```

---

### [](https://dev.to/taipy/how-to-create-an-ai-photo-app-with-python-23g8?ref=dailydev#frontend-folder)Frontend folder

Let‚Äôs get our fresh new model and copy it from our neural-network-builder project into our frontend folder.  
Create two files in our root folder inside of¬†_frontend_:

- _index.py_
- _index.css_.

These are the files we will run for our GUI.

---

### [](https://dev.to/taipy/how-to-create-an-ai-photo-app-with-python-23g8?ref=dailydev#set-your-css-preferences-indexcss)Set your CSS preferences: index.css

Add this code to the index.css file we just made:  

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Alegreya+Sans:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,700;0,800;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,700;1,800;1,900&display=swap');

body {
  background: rgb(36, 57, 86);

  font-family: 'Alegreya Sans', sans-serif;

  font-weight: 400;

  font-style: normal;

  font-size: 18px;
}

.container {
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.attachment,
.prediction {
  display: flex;

  flex-flow: row nowrap;

  align-items: center;
}

.attachment div {
  margin: 1rem;
}

.prediction p {
  margin-right: 1rem;
}
```

### [](https://dev.to/taipy/how-to-create-an-ai-photo-app-with-python-23g8?ref=dailydev#create-the-indexpy-python-script)Create the index.py Python script

To create an application with Taipy, you can use Markdown, the Python API, or HTML.  
In this tutorial, we will use the¬†**HTML**¬†method, but feel free to use whichever option!

And lastly, add this code to the¬†_index.py_¬†script:  

``` python
from taipy.gui import Gui
from taipy.gui import Html
from tensorflow.keras import models
from PIL import Image
import tensorflow
import numpy as np


class_names = {
    0: 'airplane',

}


model = models.load_model("C:/Users/marin/Documents/GitHub/AB/ml-photo-app/model/cifar-10-batches-py-model.keras")


def predict_image(model, path_to_img):
    img = Image.open(path_to_img)
    img = img.convert("RGB")
    img = img.resize((32, 32))
    data = np.asarray(img)
    data = data / 255
    logits = model.predict(np.array([data])[:1])
    probs = tensorflow.nn.softmax(logits).numpy()

    top_prob = probs.max()
    top_pred = class_names[np.argmax(probs)]

    return top_prob, top_pred


opt = tensorflow.keras.optimizers.legacy.Adam(learning_rate=0.1)
